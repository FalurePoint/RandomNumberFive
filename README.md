# Random Number Five

## The simplest (or worst) random number generator you have ever used.

<p>Random Number Five also known as RandomNumber5 is a random number generator written in python woth a very simple
UI that takes advanage of the power of GTK4 and GNOME Builder allowing me to i'have written it in under 20 minutes!<p>

<p> OK, I will be honest now, I made it to have something to use to feel out the Flatpak publishing system be fore I publish a project I have been working on for a few years now. i
t is probably not the best reandom number generator ever but it works (and the icon is kinda cool :P)<p>
<p>If you find it usefull great!  but most likely no one will.<p>
<p>If you want help with GTK/Flatpak/GNOME Builder and python feel free to reach out to me at kl5is@protonmail.com and I will try to be of some help! I know for me it was very hard due to very little documentation for those using python so I will be more then glad to help any one else trying to follow the same road with what little I know!

# How to install
## why on earth would you want to do a thing like that??
<P> OK, if you insist then you can install it. You should be able to install it from flatpak with ```flatpak install flathub org.failurepoint.randomnumber```
.
<p> or if you rather build it your self with GNOME Builder you can go to: `Open Project>Clone Repository` and in "Repository URL"  type ```https://github.com/FalurePoint/RandomNumber5``` and hit clone.
